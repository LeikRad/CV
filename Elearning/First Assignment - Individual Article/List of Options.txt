There are two types of topics:

    1) Those that require writing a 4-page article and are more conceptual in nature (C). The 4-pages are expected to provide an overview of the interest and main aspects about the topic, also providing a small list of selected reading sources;
    2) those requiring a 4-page tutorial and a demo script (in Python), marked with T, which have a more technical nature. The 4-pages, in this case, should explain the concept, overall ideas, and methods and provide enough information to help the reader replicate the demo.

None of the two types of topics is expected to be easier or harder. However, please note that the T topics will require some programming.
